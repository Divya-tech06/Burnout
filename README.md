🎓 Student Stress & Burnout Analyzer

A web-based application that evaluates student stress and burnout levels using academic, lifestyle, and mental-health indicators. The system performs real-time analysis without storing any personal data, ensuring privacy, transparency, and ease of use.

📌 Project Overview

The Student Stress & Burnout Analyzer collects 10 key inputs including sleep habits, academic workload, CGPA, anxiety levels, screen time, and physical activity. Using a normalized weighted scoring approach, the system computes a burnout score, identifies high-risk factors, and provides actionable recommendations to support student well-being and academic performance.

🚀 Key Features

• Real-time burnout and stress scoring (0–100 scale)
• Uses academic, lifestyle, and mental-health indicators
• Identifies critical risk factors such as poor sleep, high anxiety, and low physical activity
• Generates personalized improvement recommendations
• Clean, responsive, and user-friendly interface
• Privacy-first design — no login, no database, no data storage

🧠 Methodology

The application applies a client-side normalized and weighted scoring model to convert user inputs into standardized stress indices. These indices are aggregated to calculate an overall burnout score and corresponding stress category.

This transparent statistical approach ensures explainability and avoids black-box automation.
